# Imagr Snippets For Atom

This package adds a collection of Imagr snippets for the Atom Editor. These snippets are designed to easily create Imagr_config.plist files.

## Syntax

All snippets are prefixed with "imagr_" to avoid any potential conflicts with other snippets you may have enabled.

Snippets that contain defined inputs can be maneuvered through by simply pressing the tab key.
